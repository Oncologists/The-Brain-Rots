## Overview
Collaborated in a game jam to develop a top-down bullet hell shooter featuring a multi-phase boss encounter. Implemented boss behavior using a state machine pattern in Unity C#, managing attack phases and transitions. Integrated animations through Unity Animator Controllers for smooth visual feedback. Designed and synchronized sound effects to enhance gameplay immersion. Worked alongside animators and programmers to deliver a cohesive and engaging experience.
